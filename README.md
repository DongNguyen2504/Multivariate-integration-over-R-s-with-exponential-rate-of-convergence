# Multivariate-integration-over-R-s-with-exponential-rate-of-convergence
We analyze the approximation of multivariate integrals over the Euclidean space for functions which are analytic. We show explicit upper bounds which attain the exponential rate of convergence. We use an infinite grid with different mesh sizes in each direction to sample the function, and then truncate it. In our analysis, the mesh sizes and the truncated domain are chosen by optimally balancing the truncation error and the discretization error.
